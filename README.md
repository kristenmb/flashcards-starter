# FlashCards

## Description
In this project I developed a FlashCard game that runs on the command line to test user knowledge about JavaScript principles. A question is asked followed by three multiple choice options. User can scan options using arrow buttons on keyboard and chooses an option by hitting enter. The program will then tell the user if their answer was correct. Upon hitting enter again, the next question will appear. When all questions for the round have been asked and answered, the user will be given a percentage score of their accuracy.
