# FlashCards

## Description
In this project I developed a FlashCard game that runs on the command line to test user knowledge about JavaScript principles. A question is asked followed by three multiple choice options. User can scan options using arrow buttons on keyboard and chooses an option by hitting enter. The program will then tell the user if their answer was correct. Upon hitting enter again, the next question will appear. When all questions for the round have been asked and answered, the user will be given a percentage score of their accuracy.

## Planning

This project was managed using a project board that can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/ZiOXtNoy/flashcards)

### Challanges
* Managing multiple files - I occassionally got overwhelmed by the number of files we were working with and remembering the order in which they needed to be access. This is simply because I have never worked with so many files depending on each other before, but it was a good challenge.

* Familiarizing with mocha and chai - I did have to do a bit more familiarization with mocha and chai syntax and utilization.

### Wins
* Overall understand was high from the start - I felt comfortable with the process of TDD, and it was nice to see how a small application can come together utilizing implementation files in tandem. There were a few small details I had to reminded myself of or learn in regards to testing, but overall the process clicked quickly.
